# Static hosting for the React control plane.

# Private bucket behind CloudFront with an Origin Access Control, rather than a
# public bucket with website hosting. A public bucket cannot serve HTTPS on a custom
# domain and puts every object one misconfigured policy away from being writable;
# OAC means the bucket has no public access at all and only CloudFront can read it.
#
# The SPA needs one non-obvious piece: the app uses client-side routing, so a request
# for /callback or /playlists/<id> has no corresponding S3 object. Without the custom
# error responses below, a person completing sign-in would land on an XML access-denied
# page instead of the app -- the redirect URI is exactly such a path, so this breaks
# authentication specifically rather than some rare deep link.
